Hi Y’all! My name is Carly Burwell, and I was born and raised in Frisco, Texas. Currently, I am a student at the University of Oklahoma, studying Psychology with minors in Business and Spanish. I have a passion for children, writing, cooking, music, scrapbooking, learning, and trying new things. I plan to attend graduate school in 2022 to pursue school psychology, a career that embodies all of the things that I love. 

My idea for this blog is to have a safe space to write about myself and have the ability to share my personality and experiences with others. I also envision sharing some of my favorite recipes and even school papers that I am proud of. My personal mission statement is to be a leader who finds joy in all circumstances who, in turn, allows others to discover and experience that same joy- and I hope I can do that through this platform. Welcome into the ambitious, diligent, lighthearted, and adventurous mind that you’ll come to know as “Carly”!
