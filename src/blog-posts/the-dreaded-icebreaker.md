Picture this: It is the first day of class or the first time you are meeting with an organization on campus- what is an activity that is always done when you meet a group of others for the first time? You guessed it, the dreaded, icebreaker question. I must admit, my least favorite icebreaker is two truths and a lie. (Please tell me this isn’t a thing in the business world, haha!) I feel as if I am not super interesting or creative when it comes to icebreakers. Some of my friends have cool facts like that they are cousins with a famous football player or that they can speak 4 different languages. While I can’t boast a famous relative or meeting Taylor Swift randomly at a Target- I do have quite boring and uninteresting facts about myself. My idea for this beginner blog post is just go over some of those really dull facts about me, I hope you enjoy!

1.	**I am 20 years old.** 

My birthday is March 4th, 2000.. March 4th is also known as National Marching Day, National Grammar Day, or my personal favorite- National Pound Cake Day!

2.	**I really love to travel internationally.** 

Some of my favorite places I have been include Aruba, Paris, Jamaica and Belgium. 

3.	**I also really love to travel around the United States.** 

It is on my bucket list to visit, and do an activity, in every single state! So far, I have accomplished 16/50.

4.	**I am 100% a dog person.** 

Dogs are my favorite animal, but if I had to choose my favorite zoo/exotic animal it would either be zebras or otters. Don’t ask why… I’m not really sure why myself. 

5.	**I am an only child.** 

I have never seen it as lonely though, I have always surrounded myself with friends that feel like siblings- minus the sharing and fighting!

6.	**I am a Christian!** 

This is a huge part of me, how I make decisions, and how I live out my life. I am proud to call myself a Christian and I strive to show others the joy I have found in Christ.

7.	**I am a Texan.** 

My mom is from California and my dad is from Canada, but I am, through and through, a Texas Gal. My parents met in Texas when they both relocated here to work for the same company. Since then, we have lived in the same house in the same city!

8. **I love music.**

I played the flute for 7 years and was even a section leader in my high school band. I can also, very minimally, play percussion and piano. While playing music is fun, nowadays I usually listen instead. I love all types of music and listen to all types of artists. My most listened to genre is probably alternative or pop.

9.	**I am obsessed with going to concerts.**

Concerts are one of my favorite events to attend and I have been to over 15 different concerts. My favorites have been Twenty One Pilots, Miley Cyrus, AJR, Ariana Grande, and Rex Orange County. 

10.	 **I love to cook and bake.** 

My dad was a chef in his early twenties and can cook without even having a recipe. I have watched, helped, and taken in all of his different recipes and love to cook those dishes for others (I love love love to host other people!) I personally like to cook Asian and Indian food the most, but I must admit… I use a recipe.

11.	**I am a huge movie fan.** 

I like all genres of movies, even horror. While I am not a “movie nerd” and I can’t name every scene in Harry Potter or Avengers, I do love to watch lots of movies. However, I love the experience of going to the movies the most. Nothing beats the smell of overpriced, buttery popcorn and snacks. 

12.	**I am a highly sensitive person- and learning this helped me accept the way that I view things.** 

I have realized that it may be weird or different, but it’s just who I am. I have big feelings, I am a seeker, I am a challenger, I get hangry (it’s really bad y’all, I keep snacks on me 24/7) , I am strongly empathetic, and I am conscientious.

13.	**Crappy reality shows are my thing.** 

I absolutely love the Real Housewives, Married at First Sight, 90 Day Fiancée, Love is Blind, Temptation Island, The Bachelor, and all other life-sucking, binge-worthy, drama-filled television shows. I also like reality game shows like Big Brother, Amazing Race, and Survivor. 

14.	**My favorite sport to watch is hockey and football.** 

You probably won't see my watching any other sport unless forced by my dad or boyfriend. My favorite hockey team is the Dallas Stars or Toronto Maple Leafs. My favorite college football team is obviously OU, but I also like to watch the Cowboys, except for when they are losing terribly. 

15.	 **I hate the smell of coconut and I hate the taste of cilantro.** 

While I wouldn’t call myself a picky eater, I would call myself a texture eater. If the texture of food is slimy or weird, I will probably not eat it. 

16.	**My favorite color is ~~pink~~ undecided.** 

I love to wear patterns and bright colors but other times I like to just wear blacks and greys. My room is a pink, green, blue, yellow floral theme. I think after typing this, maybe I don’t have a favorite color, haha.

17.	**I have never broken any bone in my body.** 

I feel like that makes me sound really boring and unadventurous- but I guess I have just been lucky!

18.	**I would much rather eat something salty than sweet.** 

While I do like cakes and cupcakes if I had to choose between a sweet treat or some chips/trail mix/goldfish, I would 100%, almost every time, go with the salty snack. 

19.	**My go-to drink is Diet Coke.** 

There was a time in my life where I rarely ever drank water- and just drank Diet Coke. Thinking back, that wasn’t the best option but, I still do love my occasional, overpriced Diet Coke when I go out to restaurants. If you want to know the key to my heart, it’s Diet Coke and salty snacks!

20.	**I love to shop, especially for shoes.** 

I have to confess that I love to buy really unique shoes that most would call “ugly.” I think they are a great conversation starter and a great way to spice up an outfit. Are 85 pairs of shoes too much? Yeah, you’re right… it is. 


Well, that is all I am going to share for this blog post. I hope you didn’t find these facts completely boring and that you have learned a little bit more about me and my personality.

I’ll see you next time!
