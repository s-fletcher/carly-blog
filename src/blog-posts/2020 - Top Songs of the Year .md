If you want to get to know a person in an unconventional and fun way, ask them their favorite artist or song. I really believe that one of the most insightful ways to learn about someone is through their music taste. If I meet a friend who only listens to country music, I run. If I meet a friend who is stuck in their middle school pop music phase, I take them under my wing and show them REAL music. All jokes aside, I like friends who have different music tastes than I do. As the year wraps up, I asked 3 of my dear friends what their top song of the year was. 

Abby is one of my best friends that I have met in college. Her and I can’t go more than a week without hanging out and when we do, it is usually filled with us screaming 2010 top hits at the top of our lungs as we are driving to Chuy’s for lunch. We love the old pop hits, but when I asked Abby what her go-to song of the year was she responded with Home by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros.

Sam is my boyfriend and him and I have a fairly similar music taste. He prefers a little more rap than I do, but he can appreciate the soft alternative music that I like to listen to. He has showed me most of the artists that are my favorites today, and I am grateful for his good taste in music. His favorite song was Heat Waves by Glass Animals.

Natalie is one of my friends from high school who also goes to OU. Her and I go to campus ministry activities every week together, and on the drive there we listen to old pop songs and contemporary Christian music. It was no surprise to me that her favorite song was Authority by Elevation Worship.

As I asked my friends what their favorite song of the year was, I thought to myself “Well, what were MY favorite songs?” To be honest, I can never think of my favorite song when put on the spot, and even scrolling through my Spotify it is impossible to pick just one. So, I am going to make a little 8 song overview of the best tunes I have had on repeat, getting me through 2020.
