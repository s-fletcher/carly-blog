_"In the cookie of life, friends are  the choclate chips."

Welcome back to the final part of the two-part series on how to find friends in college! In my last post, I talked about the importance of being yourself, honest about what you want from your friends, and bold when trying to find friends. Today, we will finish out this series with my final few pieces of advice when trying to find your people in a new environment, like college. 

## 1. Say Yes!

If someone invites you somewhere- say yes. Coffee, study night, movies, rollerblading, dinner at the cafeteria on campus, whatever it may be- say yes. If someone invites you somewhere you should take that opportunity in an instant. It is always easy to think about the paper you have coming up or your nice warm bed and favorite Netflix show; but, instead, think about a new connection and lifelong friend you could make just from one social outing.
What is there to be afraid of? Awkwardness. I get it, everybody dreads that awkward moment of silence when you meet a new person and run out of things to talk about. If you are really that worried about it, come up with some questions to ask your new friend! You’ll be surprised though that you probably won't even get to ask all your premade questions because the conversation will divert, and you and your new friend will have a natural conversation that flows normally. 
The beauty of saying yes is that it gives you an opportunity to find a friend, or even realize that this person isn’t the right friend for you. How will you know if you like chocolate chip cookies if you never try them?
