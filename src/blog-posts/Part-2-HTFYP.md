*"In the cookie of life, friends are the chocolate chips."*


**1. Say Yes!**

If someone invites you somewhere- say yes. Coffee, study night, movies, rollerblading, dinner at the cafeteria on campus, whatever it may be- say yes. If someone invites you somewhere you should take that opportunity in an instant. It is always easy to think about the paper you have coming up or your nice warm bed and favorite Netflix show; but, instead, think about a new connection and lifelong friend you could make just from one social outing.

What is there to be afraid of? Awkwardness. I get it, everybody dreads that awkward moment of silence when you meet a new person and run out of things to talk about. If you are really that worried about it, come up with some questions to ask your new friend! You’ll be surprised though that you probably won't even get to ask all your premade questions because the conversation will divert, and you and your new friend will have a natural conversation that flows normally. 
The beauty of saying yes is that it gives you an opportunity to find a friend, or even realize that this person isn’t the right friend for you. 
How will you know if you like chocolate chip cookies if you never try them?

**2. Find a Common Interest and Get Involved Together."

In college, there are so many clubs and organizations to get involved in. When you get plugged in, you get connected to new people. 

Do some research of clubs on your campus and find some that speak to you. This can be anything from lettuce eating club, a dance team, or a welcome committee for freshman. Once you join a club or organization you are guaranteed to find someone who is interested in at least one same thing as you: whether that be a passion for lettuce or dance- it’s something! When you are able to share a common interest in something, it is easier to connect on a deeper level and become good friends with someone.
I have met most of my closest college friends through a Christian sorority and an honor society which was great because I knew that we all shared a common interest and foundation. After joining, I realized that I had friends that I could go out and do things with. Together we: went out and served the community, had prayer groups together, went to church together, hosted events, study nights, and a book club. This was all made possible by getting involved in a club together. These connections formed because we spent time together and we were enjoying what we were doing. 

**3. Reminder of Quality Over Quantity.**
