***Tips for Getting the Most Out of Your Senior Photos*** ... *from a picky senior who just got her photos done and loves every single one.*

Senior pictures are important. They document one of your biggest accomplishments- graduation! You have worked years for your degree, and you need pictures to celebrate it!!

If you are anything like me, taking photos can be a huge ordeal. I am quite picky when it comes to photos of just myself. I don't like how my hair looks, my arm looks big, or I don't like the way my outfit is laying on my body. Taking senior photos was a huge stressor for me- I wanted these photos to be perfect and I wanted to love how I looked. I am only graduating from the University of Oklahoma once, and I need the pictures to prove it. Pictures for friends, family, my LinkedIn profile, and of course Instagram. 

I spent weeks planning my senior photos and I want to be able to give you all the best advice and pointers that I thought of for my big picture day. I must say I absoultely love every.single.photo that was taken of me. As I begin this post I want to give a huge shoutout to my photographer- Carysn Craytor. I will talk about her more in the section entilted "Photographer" but please follow her on Instagram (@carsyn.craytor), give her some love, and book her if you are in the area (carsyncraytor.com)! 

Without further ado, here is a list of tips for getting the most out of your senior photos... from a picky senior who got her photos done and loves every single one.
