***Tips for Getting the Most Out of Your Senior Photos*** ... *from a picky senior who just got her photos done and loves every single one.*

Senior pictures are important. They document one of your biggest accomplishments- graduation! You have worked years for your degree, and you need pictures to celebrate it!!

If you are anything like me, taking photos can be a huge ordeal. I am quite picky when it comes to photos of just myself. I don't like how my hair looks, my arm looks big, or I don't like the way my outfit is laying on my body. Taking senior photos was a huge stressor for me- I wanted these photos to be perfect and I wanted to love how I looked. I am only graduating from the University of Oklahoma once, and I need the pictures to prove it. Pictures for friends, family, my LinkedIn profile, and of course Instagram. 

I spent weeks planning my senior photos and I want to be able to give you all the best advice and pointers that I thought of for my big picture day. I must say I absoultely love every.single.photo that was taken of me. As I begin this post I want to give a huge shoutout to my photographer- Carysn Craytor. I will talk about her more in the section entilted "Photographer" but please follow her on Instagram (@carsyn.craytor), give her some love, and book her if you are in the area (carsyncraytor.com)! 

Without further ado, here is a list of tips for getting the most out of your senior photos... from a picky senior who got her photos done and loves every single one. 

**Photographer**

I already mentioned that my photographer was fantastic and I truly believe that was key- finding the right photographer. 

When researching photographers, you want to make sure that you like their body of work and they are in your price range. What type of aestetic and finishing touches do you like on your photos? Do you like clean, airbrushed, or more of a sepia look?

When I was searching, I came across Carsyn Craytor. I loved all of her work and her personal biography really struck me. I could tell that Carsyn was genuine, loving, and wanted to put her all into my photos and make my day special. Let me tell you, I was not wrong! Carsyn was amazing. Her and I clicked instantly, and I could tell she understood my vision and what I wanted. 

When you find the right photographer, it is easy to voice your worries, fears, wants, and needs. Carsyn asked me important questions like “What’s your best side?” and “Do you like your hair behind or in front of your ears?” These are things I didn’t even think of, but she was very diligent and told me if I tucked my hair behind my ears (which I hate!), if my necklace chain was messed up, or that my dress was wrinkled. I think it is very important to have a photographer that can be honest with you and tell you when you look a little crazy- better they tell you in the moment instead of when you get all your photos back!

In short, do your research and find someone you love. When you meet them make sure to tell them your vision, what you like, don't like, and any insecurities. That leads me into my next point- Have a vision. 

**Creating a Vision**

This was the most fun part of my journey of getting my senior photos done. I spent hours looking at photos and saving ones that I liked. Creating a vision includes finding examples of poses you like, brainstorming where you want to take the photos, and being real with yourself.

First, finding poses you like. I knew that I wanted typical graduation poses like throwing my cap in the air and popping champagne. Do you want these as well, do you want more unconventional poses, or maybe none of the "typical poses". 

Second, brainstorm where on campus you want your photos. I think in front of the library is a must- especially if you have a beautiful library like OU. Do you have a building on campus where your degree is housed? Do you have a building that has special importance do you? Do you have a greenery wall on campus? Do you have flags or a sign with your college's name on it? What about the football stadium? 

There are many areas that I wanted to incorportate into my photos, so I made a map and made sure to go in a specific order so that I could maximize my time and get as many photos and locations that I wanted. I booked a 1.5 to 2 hour session and had the ability to get photographed in 5 major locations on campus.

Third, be real with yourself. Do you have anything that you are uncomfortable with? For me, I do not like how my arms photograph when I wear sleeveless tops or dresses. Maybe for you it is your ears, stomach, or your legs. It is true that the camera can add 10 pounds, us ladies know it!

Lastly, and most importantly, communicate these with your photographer! It is best to do it before your shoot and during as well. If you let your photographer know before hand then they are able to help you navigate how to pose and help you map out the best locations for your photos. Also, just remind them during the photos as well, what you like or are insecure about. 

However, do not be so wrapped up in your vision that you don't allow your photographer to give you suggestions! Some of my favorite photos are ones that Carsyn prompted me to do. For example, she had me play with my hair to shape my arms in a better way and she had me cross my legs when standing to look thinner. 

Carsyn listened to my worries and came prepared with suggestions to combat these. Find a photographer who is willing to do the same for you. Create that vision and communicate it clearly- but be open to suggestions.

Now on to everyones favorite part- Outfits!
