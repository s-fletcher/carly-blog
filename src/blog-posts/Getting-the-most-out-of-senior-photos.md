***Tips for Getting the Most Out of Your Senior Photos*** ... *from a picky senior who just got her photos done and loves every single one.*

Senior pictures are important. They document one of life's significant accomplishments- graduation! You have worked years for your degree, and you need pictures to celebrate it!!

If you are anything like me, taking photos can be a huge ordeal. I am quite picky when it comes to photos of just myself. I don't like how my hair looks, my arm looks big, or I don't like the way my outfit is lying on my body. Taking senior photos was a huge stressor for me- I wanted these photos to be perfect, and I wanted to love how I looked. I am only graduating from the University of Oklahoma once, and I need the pictures to prove it. Photos for friends, family, my LinkedIn profile, and of course, Instagram. 

I spent weeks planning my senior photos, and I want to give you all the best advice and pointers that I thought of for my big picture day. I must say I absolutely love every.single.photo that was taken of me. As I begin this post, I want to give a huge shout out to my photographer- Carysn Craytor. I will talk about her more in the section entitled "Photographer" but please follow her on Instagram (@carsyn.craytor), give her some love, and book her if you are in the area (carsyncraytor.com)! 

Without further ado, here is a list of tips for getting the most out of your senior photos... from a picky senior who got her photos done and loves every single one. 

**Photographer**

I already mentioned that my photographer was fantastic, and I genuinely believe that was key- finding the right photographer. 

When researching photographers, you want to make sure that you like their body of work and they are in your price range. What type of aesthetic and finishing touches do you like on your photos? Do you like clean, airbrushed, or more of a sepia look?

When I was searching, I came across Carsyn Craytor. I loved all of her work, and her personal biography really struck me. I could tell that Carsyn was genuine, loving, and wanted to put her all into my photos and make my day special. Let me tell you, I was not wrong! Carsyn was amazing. Her and I clicked instantly, and I could tell she understood my vision and what I wanted. 

When you find the right photographer, it is easy to voice your worries, fears, wants, and needs. Carsyn asked me important questions like “What’s your best side?” and “Do you like your hair behind or in front of your ears?”. These are things I didn’t even think of, but she was very diligent and told me if I tucked my hair behind my ears (which I hate!), if my necklace chain was messed up, or that my dress was wrinkled. I think it is very important to have a photographer that can be honest with you and tell you when you look a little crazy- better they tell you in the moment instead of when you get all your photos back!

In short, do your research and find someone you love. When you meet your photographer, make sure to tell them your vision, what you like, don't like, and any insecurities. That leads me to my next point- Have a vision. 

**Creating a Vision**

This was the most fun part of my journey of getting my senior photos done. I spent hours looking at photos and saving ones that I liked. Creating a vision includes finding examples of poses you like, brainstorming where you want to take the photos, and being real with yourself.

First, find poses you like. I knew that I wanted typical graduation poses like throwing my cap in the air and popping champagne. Do you want these as well, do you want more unconventional poses, or maybe none of the "typical poses". 

Second, brainstorm where on campus you want your photos. I think in front of the library is a must- especially if you have a beautiful library like OU. Do you have a building on campus where your degree is housed? Do you have a building that has particular importance do you? Do you have a greenery wall on campus? Do you have flags or a sign with your college's name on it? What about the football stadium? 

There are many areas that I wanted to incorportate into my photos, so I made a map and made sure to go in a specific order so that I could maximize my time and get as many photos and locations that I wanted. I booked a 1.5 to 2-hour session and had the ability to get photographed in 5 major locations on campus.

Third, be real with yourself. Do you have anything that you are uncomfortable with? For me, I do not like how my arms photograph when I wear sleeveless tops or dresses. Maybe for you it is your ears, stomach, or your legs. The camera can indeed add 10 pounds, us ladies know it!

Lastly, and most importantly, communicate these with your photographer! It is best to do it before your shoot and during as well. If you let your photographer know beforehand, they can help you navigate how to pose and help you map out the best locations for your photos. Also, just remind them during the photos as well, what you like or are insecure about. 

However, do not be so wrapped up in your vision that you don't allow your photographer to give you suggestions! Some of my favorite photos are ones that Carsyn prompted me to do. For example, she had me play with my hair to shape my arms in a better way, and she had me cross my legs when standing to look thinner.

Carsyn listened to my worries and came prepared with suggestions to combat these. Find a photographer willing to do the same for you. Create that vision and communicate it clearly- but be open to suggestions.

Now on to everyone's favorite part- Outfits!


**Outfits**

Outfits are probably one of the main things you think about when planning for any picture. For senior pictures, outfits are especially important because they bring depth and character. Outfits show your personality!

Picking outfits that you are comfortable in is key. Along with comfortability is how the outfit looks in pictures. Before your photo shoot, take pictures in your outfit just on your cell phone. See how the outfit photographs- is it too baggy, does it give you shape, does it sit weird? If you don't like how it photographs on a cell phone, you won't like how it photographs on the day of! 

I had a fun time picking out outfits, and I just knew what I wanted. I had 4 major outfit changes. 

1. The first outfit had to be one that would look good with my gown, hats, and colorful regalia.  For me this dress was white. I have seen every color of dress be used for regalia photos though. In my opinion, I wanted a very clean look, and white provided me with that.
2. My second outfit was my "personality" outfit. I chose a dress that was patterned because I love to wear patterns. This personality outfit could be your favorite color or any outfit that you wear that you just love.
3. My third outfit was my favorite. It was simple jeans and a t-shirt in front of the football stadium. My t-shirt wasn't just any old t-shirt though, it said "OU Alumni" on it! Some girls choose to do jerseys or game day outfits- but I was never that type of girl and felt this fit my personality perfectly.
4. My last outfit was my school color- crimson. This was my celebratory outfit that I wore when popping champagne! I think everyone should have a dress in their school color- it is such a great way to show school spirit without having to wear a logo or the name of your University.

*Accessories*

Now, I know that many might think that accessories are not that important- but let me tell you- I think that they made my pictures! I loved that I changed shoes and jewelry for every outfit. It really allowed me to show my personality and pick shoes and jewelry pieces that are important to me. I got to wear heels I got for my 21st birthday, my grandmother's old gold necklace, and my special 10 Commandments bracelet. These pieces wouldn't go with every outfit I had, so accessory changes were imperative. If you are worried about time, bag each accessory up together based on the outfit, and it takes 1-minute max!

*Regalia*

Graduation regalia was a must for me.  I had lots of graduation regalia, and it was important for me to show it off! 

I had lots of pictures in my full regalia- cap, gown, stole, hood, and cords. However, I don’t like how I look in hats, so I made sure to only take a few in my cap. I was also worried about how the gown would make my figure look- I made sure to take a few without the gown and just with the cords and stole. Lastly, I took some with just my stole and hood. In short, have variety!!

Don’t be afraid to tell your photographer you want lots of options. I feel like a majority of a senior photo shoot should be in regalia and showing off all your accomplishments. Lastly, if there is an important building on campus where you worked or where a club was housed- make sure to get a photo there! I was very involved in an honor society, and some of my favorite photos were in front of that building wearing my cord and stole commemorating my experiences with them.

*Props*

Props! Super fun but don’t let them take over. Flowers, biodegradable confetti, champagne, or powder bombs are great ideas. I personally did only three props, a red powder bomb, pom-pom's, and the classic champagne. I am glad I didn’t waste too much time on props, but I really enjoyed the pictures I got! Champagne (or grape juice in my photos) is a must-have! The pictures were adorable, and it’s a great time to show personality and excitement. However, if you decide to do champagne, make sure you save it for last- you will be sticky!

</div>


Lastly, if you ordered a class ring- this is the prime opportunity to wear it. I love the photos I got that showed my class ring in detail. 

*Personality*

Make sure to get photos that showcase your personality. This could mean laughing photos, serious photos, and photos with your school hand sign. For me, this meant holding up a "One" loud and proud, and of course, a big horns down!

**Bring A Friend or Family Member**

My last tip is to bring a family member or friend with you. Especially if you have outfit changes and graduation regalia, you need someone to help with all of it. I was lucky enough to bring my parents, and my mom brought a wagon. A wagon is a must-have!!! In the wagon we had all my outfits, regalia, jewelry, and essentials (such as mascara, oil blotting sheets, and wipes for the champagne).

If you are lucky enough to drag a friend or family members- have them wear something nice! For example, my parents wore jeans and OU t-shirts. When I changed into my "OU Alumni" shirt, we all had the opportunity to take a few photos together in front of the football stadium. It was a great way to commemorate my experiences with them at college football games and to thank them for helping me get through college!

As I wrap up this blog post, I hope it helped you get the most out of your senior photos! Find the right photographer, have a vision, choose outfits that speak to you, bring accessories, and have a friend there with you! Graduation photos are for you and your liking. It is a time to celebrate you and your accomplishments- so do what you like, wear what you want, and pose how you like! Again, if you are in the OKC area- feel free to book my photographer Carsyn Craytor (carsyncraytor.com).  I can not recommend her enough.

Congratulations on such a huge accomplishment! I hope you love your photos and that my tips have helped!
