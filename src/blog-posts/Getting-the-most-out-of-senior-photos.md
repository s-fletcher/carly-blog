***Tips for Getting the Most Out of Your Senior Photos***

*from a picky senior who just got her photos done and loves every single one.*

Senior pictures are important. They document one of your biggest accomplishments- graduation! You have worked years for your degree, and you need pictures to celebrate it!!

If you are anything like me, taking photos can be a huge ordeal. I am quite picky when it comes to photos of just myself. I don't like how my hair looks, my arm looks big, or I don't like the way my outfit is laying on my body. Taking senior photos was a huge stressor for me- I wanted these photos to be perfect and I wanted to love how I looked. I am only graduating from the University of Oklahoma once, and I need the pictures to prove it. Pictures for friends, family, my LinkedIn profile, and of course Instagram. 

I spent weeks planning my senior photos and I want to be able to give you all the best advice and pointers that I thought of for my big picture day. I must say I absoultely love every.single.photo that was taken of me. As I begin this post I want to give a huge shoutout to my photographer- Carysn Craytor. I will talk about her more in the section entilted "Photographer" but please follow her on Instagram, give her some love, and book her if you are in the area! 

Without further ado, here is a list of important things to keep in mind when planning for your senior photo session... from a senior who got her photos done and loves every single one.
