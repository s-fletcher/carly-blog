**Top Songs of 2021**

You know what time of the year it is- Spotify Wrapped time! I love seeing everyone post what their top songs are, their most played genre, and the real kicker- how long they have listened for! As I have mentioned before, I believe that music is one of the coolest and best ways to learn about a person. 

This year I spent 43,015 minutes listening to music- which is more than 90% of Spotify listeners. As you can tell, music is a huge part of my life! I listen to music all the time- while I am cleaning, showering, studying, or trying to fall asleep. 

With that being said, it's time for you to learn a little about me though my top songs of 2021. I feel like this is the year of the album! There were so many albums that dropped this year that I love. 

**Albums**

My top album of the year has to be Happier than Ever by Billie Eilish. When I tell you I like every single song, I mean every. single. song. 
My top songs on the album have to be:
  1.	Getting Older
  2.	I Didn’t Change My Number
  3.	Billie Bossa Nova
  4.	Happier Than Ever


Another album that I fell in love with this year was Twenty One Pilots, Scaled and Icy. I have always been a huge TOP fan and this album did not disappoint. If you’re looking for something different, listen to the livestream version of the album! It really feels like you are at the concert with them. My favorite two songs off that discography are:
  1.	Choker
  2.	The Outside


Now, I hate to be basic but Olivia Rodrigo’s debut album, Sour, was phenomenal. I feel like any person could relate to her songs and could scream them at the top of their lungs. While I also love every song on this album, there are a few that are superior in my opinion.
  1.	Hope Ur Ok
  2.	Happier

The last album of the year that I obsessed over was Lil Nas X’s Montero. I love his carefree vibe and his songs are so catchy. My top 3 hits off the album are:
  1.	Am I Dreaming (feat. Miley Cyrus)
  2.	Lost in the Citadel
  3.	Tales of Dominica

**Singles** 

Lastly, there were a few single songs that I really enjoyed this year too. These are songs that I can just jam out to without a care in the world.
  1.	Girls Want Girls by Drake
  2.	Rubberband by Tate McRae
  3.	Issues by Baby Keem 

**Revisted Old Favorites**
Last year, I included an honorable mention in my Top Songs of 2020. This year I titled this section “Revisited Old Favorites.” This was a year where I spent a lot of time listening to old throwbacks mixed in with new, fresh songs. These revisited old favorites include:
  1.	Solo by Frank Ocean
  2.	Runaway by Kanye West
  3.	Girls/Girls/Boys by Panic at the Disco
  4.	All Night by Beyonce
  5.	Rainbow Bap (Day Trippers Edition) by Jaden Smith  

Happy New Year Friends!! I hope that you can take the time and listen to a few of these songs if you haven't listened to them yet.  I hope 2022 is the best year yet!
