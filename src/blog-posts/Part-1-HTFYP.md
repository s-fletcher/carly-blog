*"In the cookie of life, friends are the chocolate chips."*


Friends make life sweet and enjoyable. However, at times it is difficult to find your people; Especially in college when you are starting a new chapter in your life. In this **two-part series** we will explore how to find friends in college.

For preface, when I started college at the University of Oklahoma, I was in the company of all my friends from high school. However, after the first semester we all started to go our own ways and the second semester of college I spent with a new group of friends. The same thing happened and during that summer we all went our separate ways. It wasn’t until my sophomore year when I felt like I had finally found “my people.” Starting a new chapter of life is hard, whether it is college or a new job, but I have gathered some of the most important things to keep in mind when finding new friends while in college.  

**1. Be You and Be Honest.**

While this may seem like a no-brainer it is so important to remember, especially in a new atmosphere like college. There are so many new people, new ideas, and new scenes to get involved in or to not get involved in. 

It is necessary to sit down with yourself and be honest about what you want your college experience to look like. Do you like friends who like to go out and tear up the town on Saturday nights, or do you prefer movie marathon Saturdays? In simpler terms, do you like chocolate chip cookies or do you prefer oatmeal raisin? There is nothing wrong with either choice, it’s a personal preference, but you have to know what you like and be honest about what you want from your friends. Your friends can help shape the experiences you have in college, so it is important that you have the right ones for you. 

An important part of finding the right friends is being unapologetically you. Before you get to college, it’s a great idea to make a simple list of who you are and what you value. 

When I first got to college, I wrote down a few words on a sticky note. I wrote down: health, academics, love, Jesus, and adventure. These were 5 things that I really valued and spoke to my character. Coming into college, I wanted a group of friends that could value some of those same things as me and I wouldn’t waiver in those 5 important values. 

To create a lasting friendship and find your people you have to have expectations for those people. Your expectations can’t be too high, or you’ll never find your people; however, keep in mind those few things you value that you won't sacrifice. Use that list of 3-to-5 words as a guide for your expectations of your future friendships.

**2. Be Bold.**

It is hard to make friends if you don’t put in the initiative to talk to someone new! I like to argue that I am shy and the type of girl to never talk to someone new if I didn’t have to. However, one event changed the course of my life, and I don’t look at meeting new people that way anymore. 

*Warning:* This is my favorite thing that has happened to me in college! I received an email from a Christian sorority about a recruitment night they were hosting where you could go and learn about their sisterhood. I was really interested and wanted to go so bad, but I was too fearful of meeting new people and going to the event alone that I brushed it off and deleted the email. The next day, I walk into my Spanish class and hear a girl that sits at the table next to me talking about how she was going to the recruitment night. I had never talked to this girl before and I got out of my seat, walked over and said “Hi, can I go with you?” I had no idea what overcame me and when those words came out of my mouth I was embarrassed and shocked at myself and what I did. Just the day before, I would have rather ran 5 miles than walk up to someone and start a conversation without being forced to due to a group project or discussion in class. The girl looked at me and said “Of course, here’s my number I’ll meet you there!” That girls name is Abby, and she is now my best friend. I may have never met Abby, and I would 100% not be in a sorority, if I hadn’t been bold and talked to her.

Now, I am less afraid to approach people because I think back on how I met Abby and joined a great organization. I think of how many happy moments and great friendships I could miss out on, by shying away at opportunities to talk to others. I know from personal experience that a huge part of finding your people is being bold. It is scary, but you won't enjoy those chocolate chips if you pick around them and avoid them!
